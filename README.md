# GenshinWishSorter
Takes a SQL database of wishes from banners then exports data about the data set. 


Currently the application only works if the database file is located in my directy and has to be called GenshinAllWishDB.db .


Inorder for others to use it u will have to add the path and file name into the code inside of DatabaseHandler.java on lines 10,27,43, and 60.



Needs a lot of changes.
